Basics of Volume of Distribution
********************************

The volume of distribution (V\ :sub:`d`\) is a pharmacokinetic parameter representing an individual drugâ€™s propensity to either remain in the plasma or redistribute to other tissue compartments.

Volume of distribution is proportional to the dose of administration (Dose) and is inversely proportional to the plasma concentration (Conc).

.. math::
    V_d = \frac{Dose}{Conc}
